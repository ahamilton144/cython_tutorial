# cython_tutorial/WPB_containerization

This folder contains all code related to the post "Containerization and HPC (Docker + Singularity)" by Andrew Hamilton on the Water Programming Blog. 
The main focus of this blogpost is setting up a container for your code with Docker, and then using Singularity to run that container on high performance computing clusters.
I will use the simple cythonized reservoir simulation model from this cython_tutorial repository as an example application, but I don't go into detail on this model or on Cython. 
For more details on those, see the Jupyter Notebook in the main directory of this repository.
