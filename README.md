# Cython tutorial
This repository will serve as a brief introduction to Cython, for researchers interested in speeding up their Python models. 

I am still learning how to best use Cython myself, so I am not an expert. If you see anything wrong/suboptimal about what I'm doing, please let me know!

## Other resources
For more information, as always, see the [Cython docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

I also highly recommend the book ["Cython", by Kurt W. Smith](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cython/9781491901731/) for more details and examples. It also looks like the author also has a [tutorial](https://github.com/kwmsmith/scipy-2017-cython-tutorial), but I haven't tried it yet.

Lastly, if you want to write more efficient pure Python prior to diving into Cython, ["High Performance Python" by Micha Gorelick and Ian Ozsvald](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/) is a good resource.
